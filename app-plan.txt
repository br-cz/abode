High level ideas:
- Users can list their fragrance for sale
- Other users may purchase this fragrance
- Any user may list and purchase fragrances, even their own for some weird reason
- If a user attempts to buy a fragrance, the fragrance is locked for x amount of time.
    - Locked mean other users can't see nor purchase the fragrance
    - The user then has x amount of time to enter their payment information
    - If a user fails to purchase the fragrance, it will be unlocked
        - Fails = cancels purchase or runs out of time
- The price may be edited once fragrance is unlocked
    - Maybe users can haggle? Idk that might annoy sellers but that feature is common among similar apps
