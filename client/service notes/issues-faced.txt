Head issue:
ReferenceError: error is not defined, so I thought
it was would throw when no error is thrown however so I went ahead and looked it up
and used the ? operator to it would work if error was defined
however that still didnt work
then I found out error was not being set at all and so i looked at my setError hook
trying to setError via setErrors(error.response.data.errors);
 was not working, and it was because our middleware was sending
 an object named error and not errors
 Good hour gone from a typo, should learn to sift through google dev
 tools more often
