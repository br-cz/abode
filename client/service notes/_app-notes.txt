Why do we need this?
When next js tries to import a component from any of our routes,
instead of the simple way of showing the component on the screen
it first wraps it up in a custom component in next js
thats referred to as "_app"
So we simply define it ourselves and pass on the individual components
like index.js unto it
We do this because when try to use global CSS,
we can only import it in _app
